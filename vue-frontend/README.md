# Vue.js Frontend

### Requirements
* node version 8.x or newer
* npm version 5.x or newer

Install node and npm [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Check if you have the correct versions by running the following commands in your terminal:
```
node -v
```
```
npm -v
```

### Setup

Install the [Vue Devtools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd?hl=en) to easily debug and see what's going on in your Vue app.

Your text editor may not natively support the Vue syntax that is used in this project, but there may be plugins to get proper syntax highlighting. For example, Sublime Text uses the `Babel` plugin.
If you don't have a favorite text editor, or if you don't know how to get Vue support in your editor, try out VSCode.

To get started, once you are in the frontend directory of this exercise, install project dependencies:
```
npm install
```

After that's done, run this to start development:
```
npm run dev
```

This will start running the app and automatically open it at [http://localhost:8087](http://localhost:8087). Anytime you change and save the code, it will automatically reload! This will remain a running process in your terminal, so you will need to open a new tab or window to execute other commands. You can press `Ctrl-C` to stop running the frontend.

### Optional Setup
Prettier is a tool that automatically reformats your code to follow a certain set of coding style guidelines. It is configured to run automatically before each commit. This makes sure all of our code follows the same code styles, enforcing good practices and minimizing conflicts.

It is definitely not necessary for this workshop, but there are prettier plugins you can install for your editor. See instructions [here](https://github.com/prettier/prettier#editor-integration).
