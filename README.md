This repository contains the starter code for the Hack4Impact McGill Vue.js Workshop (Fall 2019). 

## Requirements

* [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or [github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
  * (Optional but nice to clone project easily)

## Setup

Make sure you have all of the required dependencies (listed above).

Clone the repository using git or github. Alternatively, you can download it as a zip file and unzip it.

From your terminal, use `cd` to get into the `vue-frontend` directory. Then use:

```bash
npm install
```
to install all of the project dependencies.

Start the project with:
```bash
npm start
```

This should automatically open the frontend application in your default browser. If not, you can try going to the following link:

```bash
http://localhost:8087
```
